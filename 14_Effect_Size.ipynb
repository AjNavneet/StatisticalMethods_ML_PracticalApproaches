        "\n",
        "- However, one crucial aspect that frequently goes overlooked in result presentations is the quantification of the actual difference or relationship, commonly referred to as the \"effect.\"\n",
        "  - It's important to remember that the core objective of an experiment is to measure an effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In fact, the primary outcome of a research investigation should be one or more measures of effect size, rather than just p-values.\n",

        "- While statistical tests can provide insights into the likelihood of an effect's existence, they do not offer insights into the size of that effect.\n",

        "## What is Effect Size?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Effect size, in the context of statistics, refers to the magnitude or size of an observed effect or result that can be expected in a broader population.\n",
        "  - It is typically estimated using sample data.\n",
        "  - Effect size methods encompass a range of statistical tools used to quantify these effects.\n",
        "  - The field of effect size measures is often referred to simply as \"effect size\" to capture its broad scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Effect size statistical methods can be broadly categorized into two groups:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Association:** These methods quantify the strength of the relationship between variables, such as correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Difference:** These methods measure the magnitude of differences between variables, like the difference between means.\n",
        "\n",
        "- An effect size can represent the outcome of a treatment compared to other groups (e.g., treated vs. untreated), or it can describe the degree of association between related variables (e.g., the relationship between treatment dosage and health).\n",
        "\n",
        "- The interpretation of an effect size calculation depends on the specific statistical method used, and the choice of measure is guided by the goals of the analysis. There are three common types of calculated results:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Standardized Result:** The effect size is expressed on a standardized scale, making it interpretable across various applications (e.g., Cohen's d calculation).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Original Units Result:** The effect size is presented in the original units of the variable, aiding in interpretation within the specific domain (e.g., the difference between two sample means).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Unit-Free Result:** The effect size lacks units, such as counts or proportions (e.g., a correlation coefficient).\n",
        "\n",
        "- Effect size can encompass the raw difference between group means (absolute effect size) or standardized measures that transform the effect into a more easily understandable scale.\n",
        "  - Absolute effect size is particularly useful when the variables being studied have intrinsic meaning, like the number of hours of sleep.\n",
        "\n",
        "- It's often advisable to report an effect size using multiple measures to cater to different types of readers of your findings.\n",
        "  - Sometimes, results are best reported in original units for ease of understanding and in standardized measures for inclusion in future meta-analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Importantly, the concept of effect size does not replace the results of a statistical hypothesis test; it complements it. Ideally, both the results of the hypothesis test and the effect size calculation should be presented side by side:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Hypothesis Test:** Quantifies the likelihood of observing the data based on a specific assumption (null hypothesis).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Effect Size:** Quantifies the size of the effect, assuming that the effect exists.\n",
