        "  2. **Algorithm Uncertainty**: Evaluating an algorithm multiple times on the same data splits provides insights into how the algorithm's performance varies independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In general, it's recommended to report on both sources of uncertainty combined. This involves fitting the algorithm on different data splits during each evaluation run, each with a new sequence of randomness.\n",
        "  - The evaluation procedure can seed the random number generator once at the beginning, and this process can be repeated, possibly 30 or more times, to generate a population of performance scores. Summarizing this population provides a fair representation of model performance, taking into account variance in both the training data and the learning algorithm itself.\n",

        "**2. Will real random numbers lead to better results?**\n",
        "   - As far as I have read, using real randomness does not help in general, unless you are working with simulations of physical processes.\n",

        "**3. What about the final model?**\n",
        "   - The final model is the chosen algorithm and configuration trained on all available training data that you can use to make predictions. The performance of this model will fall within the variance of the evaluated model.\n",
