Machine learning practitioners can benefit from understanding the terminology and methods of applied statistics, while statisticians can explore algorithmic techniques.

        "# Two Perspectives on Data\n",
        "\n",
        "Recently, some experts in statistics have looked skeptically at the field of machine learning and its approach of pursuing results at any cost. While both fields offer value, they often address similar problems in slightly different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the world of machine learning, techniques like decision trees and artificial neural networks (now often referred to as deep learning) have made significant contributions. Those working in machine learning should still be mindful of statistical principles, just as statisticians should consider the insights from machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "This idea was prominently discussed in a well-known 2001 paper titled \"Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures\" by Leo Breiman. In this paper, he compared the traditional data modeling approach used by statisticians with the algorithmic approach employed in fields like machine learning. Statisticians tend to focus on how well their models fit data, while those in other fields prioritize predictive accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Breiman argued that statistics could lose relevance and robustness by ignoring the algorithmic approach. The traditional statisticians often concentrate on making data fit their models, rather than selecting or adapting models to fit the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This exclusive reliance on data models in statistics has led to irrelevant theories, questionable conclusions, and has hindered progress on a wide range of real-world problems. If the goal of our field is to use data effectively, then we must diversify our toolkit beyond data models.\n",
